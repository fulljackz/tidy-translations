tidy-translations
=================

TidyCMS (http://tidycms.com) - translation files. Checkout and commit to provide better experience for your clients.

We use i18next as our translate system (http://i18next.com/).

Our default language is English and also fallback if current language does not contain the translation.

If you don't want to use github you can also download the English version [translation-en.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidycms/tidy-translations/master/translation-en.json), translate it and send us the translate file to support@tidycms.com.

We recommend using http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/ as a tool in writing translations and checking JSON-syntax (if no better tools available).

Tidy team will be notified if there are any commits on translations and they will be included in the next release of the UI after review.
